            "when was uconn founded": "As a UConn tour guide, I would explain that the University of Connecticut was founded in 1881 as the Storrs Agricultural School. The university was officially renamed the University of Connecticut in 1889. Over the years, the university expanded and evolved into the comprehensive research university it is today. UConn was one of the first public universities in the country to offer a wide range of academic programs and research opportunities. The founding of the university in 1881 marked the beginning of UConn's commitment to academic excellence and innovation.",
            
            "what majors are available at uconn": "UConn offers over 115 majors across 14 schools and colleges. Popular majors include Business, Engineering, Psychology, Biology, and Computer Science. The university also offers specialized programs in areas like Digital Media & Design, Allied Health Sciences, and Maritime Studies. Each department provides comprehensive curricula taught by expert faculty members. Students can also design their own individualized major through the Individualized Major Program (IMCP) if their academic interests span multiple disciplines.",
            
            "where is the library located": "The main library at UConn is the Homer Babbidge Library, located in the center of the Storrs campus. It's a four-story building situated between Fairfield Way and the Student Union. The library houses over 2.5 million volumes and provides various study spaces, computer labs, and research resources. In addition to the main library, UConn has several specialized libraries including the Music & Dramatic Arts Library, the Pharmacy Library, and the Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center. All libraries offer extensive online resources accessible to students 24/7.",
            
            "tell me about uconn housing options": "UConn offers various housing options for students. First-year students typically live in traditional residence halls like Northwest, North, and Alumni. Upperclassmen can choose from suite-style accommodations in Hilltop Apartments, Charter Oak Apartments, or Busby Suites. The university also offers Learning Communities where students with similar academic interests live together. Each residence hall has amenities like study lounges, recreation areas, and laundry facilities. Housing selection is based on a lottery system, with priority given to students with more credits. All residence halls are staffed with Resident Assistants who provide support and organize community activities.",
            
            "what are uconn's sports teams": "UConn's sports teams are called the Huskies, and they compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Big East Conference (for most sports). UConn is particularly known for its basketball programs, with the women's team having won 11 NCAA championships and the men's team having won 5. The football team competes in the FBS level of Division I as an independent. Other notable sports include soccer, field hockey, baseball, and swimming. UConn has a strong athletic tradition and school spirit, with many students attending games at venues like Gampel Pavilion, the XL Center, and Rentschler Field. The university's mascot is Jonathan the Husky."
